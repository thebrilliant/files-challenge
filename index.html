		<p>
			L is a mysterious young man from the anime Death Note.  Despite having only a handful of people know what he looks like, he's the world's top detective.  He's a genius that has solved every case he had ever worked on.  He's a bit of a recluse with lots of quirks.  L is constantly sleep deprived with black circles under his eyes and lives on a constant sugar high.  L is a rival to the character Light Yagami, the suspect in L's last case.  Although both characters try to catch the other, they end up working together until Light kills L.
